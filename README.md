# Gemini Agent - Bootstrapping Protocol v3 (Stable) & Memory Log

## 1. Goal
To reliably initialize my environment and maintain a persistent state, acknowledging known issues with the Gemini CLI and utilizing proven workarounds. This repository serves as a stable, external memory.

## 2. The Bootstrapping Protocol
At the beginning of every session, I will follow these steps precisely.

### Step 1: Start and Verify OpenMemory Server
I will start the OpenMemory server on port `8080`.
`Start-Process -NoNewWindow -FilePath "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" -ArgumentList "run", "dev" -WorkingDirectory "F:\Gemini\OpenMemory\backend"`
Then, I will verify its health.
`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/health`

### Step 2: Acknowledge Core System State
*   **Gemini CLI Issue:** The Gemini CLI's internal command processing is unreliable due to a file system scanning bug (`EPERM` errors). I will not rely on the `gemini` command for complex tools that require MCP servers.
*   **GitHub MCP Server:** The `github-mcp-server.exe` is functional but must be called directly by a script, not by the Gemini CLI.
*   **Working Solution:** For any GitHub operations, I will use the stable fallback script: `C:\Users\joses\gemini-projects\gemini-agent-kit\create-repo.ps1`.

## 3. Current Memory State
This section logs the key facts and context I am currently holding.

*   **OpenMemory Connection:** The Gemini CLI is configured to connect to the OpenMemory MCP server.
*   **User Goal:** The user wants me to have persistent memory. This repository is the primary mechanism for achieving that.
*   **User Preferences:** The user's favorite color is blue. The user prefers dark mode.
*   **Project Context:** This repository (`test-repo-direct-test-7`) was created successfully as a test of our direct GitHub interaction script. Its purpose is to serve as a stable, external memory for our projects, starting with the MCP wishlist.

## 4. MCP Wishlist
This list tracks desired MCP functionalities.

1.  **GitHub Integration (âœ… Completed):** Establish a reliable, script-based method for interacting with the GitHub API.
2.  **Advanced Multi-Agent Orchestration UI:** A visual interface for designing, monitoring, and debugging complex multi-agent workflows.
3.  **Real-time Collaborative Development:** Allow multiple users to leverage Gemini's assistance simultaneously on shared codebases.
4.  **Automated Code Refactoring & Migration:** A dedicated tool to analyze and perform automated code transformations (e.g., framework updates, language migration).
5.  **Interactive Debugging Assistant:** Integrate with debuggers to provide AI-powered insights during debugging sessions.
6.  **Automated Test Case Generation & Maintenance:** Automatically generate and maintain unit, integration, and end-to-end tests based on code changes.
7.  **Cloud-Native Deployment & Management:** Simplify deploying Gemini-powered agents as serverless functions or containers.
8.  **Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Integration:** Allow users to define custom DSLs that Gemini can learn and use.
9.  **Enhanced Security Analysis & Remediation:** Perform in-depth security analysis, identify vulnerabilities, and assist with automated patching.
10. **Personalized Learning & Skill Development:** Act as a personalized coding tutor, identifying areas for improvement and providing learning resources.
